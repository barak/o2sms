Description:  A PERL module to replay files recorded with TestGen4Web
 TestGen4Web::Runner is a PERL module to replay files recorded with
 SpikeSource's TestGen4Web Recorder.
 .
 From http://developer.spikesource.com/projects/testgen4web :
 .
 "TestGen4Web is written to ease the pain of writing tests for web applications.
 This is a 2 part tool. Firefox extension, which records user input to a xml
 file. Translator script: to generate automated test scripts."
 .
 This module fits in neither the 'recorder' or 'translator' category, instead
 directly replaying the XML files as generated by the TestGen4Web recorder.
 This leaves the implementation of the tests to the PERL developer utilizing
 this module.

 This description was automagically extracted from the module by dh-make-perl.
